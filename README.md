### CI/CD Pipeline:
The project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The pipeline is defined in the .github/workflows/ci.yml file and is triggered by push events. It ensures that code quality and standards are met by running automated checks on every push.

### Branching Strategy:
We have followed a clear branching strategy where each member has worked on their own branch, named as per the format STUDENTID-Name. All branches are merged into the main branch after code review via pull requests, ensuring that conflicts are resolved before merging.
