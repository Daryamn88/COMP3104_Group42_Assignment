Learning DevOps is essential in the software development life cycle (SDLC) because it fosters a culture of collaboration between development 
and operations teams, enhancing efficiency and productivity. By integrating DevOps practices, teams can shorten the time between writing 
code and deploying it to production, allowing for faster iterations and improvements. This results in more reliable and scalable applications,
 quicker bug fixes, and continuous delivery of high-quality software.
